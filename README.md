## Overview
We have developed a Kindle Library Management System to help users efficiently manage and organize their book collections. The system allows users to add, update, and categorize books by genre and author, while also tracking reading progress, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience similar to Kindle.

This system is built using Django and follows a microservices architecture, ensuring scalability and modularity. The key services include:
1. Book Service: Manages all book-related operations such as adding, updating, and deleting books. It tracks metadata like titles, authors, genres, and reading status (read, unread, in-progress).
2. User Service: Handles user authentication, registration, and personalized settings, allowing users to maintain their unique library.
3. Search Service: Provides fast search functionality, enabling users to efficiently search their book collections by title, author, or genre.

Each microservice operates independently and communicates via RESTful APIs, providing a flexible and scalable architecture. For asynchronous communication between services, we use RabbitMQ, which ensures that tasks are processed efficiently even under high traffic or large volumes of requests.

For service discovery and dynamic service registration, we utilize Consul. This allows services to automatically register themselves and discover other services without the need for hardcoded connections. With Consul, services can dynamically locate each other, ensuring flexibility and easy scaling as the system grows.

Each microservice operates its own PostgreSQL database, adhering to the Database-per-Service principle, ensuring data integrity and independent scaling of services.

The system is designed to be extendable, allowing for easy future additions such as advanced analytics or real-time engagement tracking.
